\chapter{Results}
\label{chp:results}

UNINETT has provided NetFlow data from one of their core routers, with flows from December 2013, in the NetFlow file format.
To simplify implementation, \verb"nfdump" was used to convert the flows to \gls{csv} files.
SpreadRank was run on the flows logged by one router over one day, one week, two weeks and one month.
Calculation of SpreadRank scores only took some minutes to complete,
 but the conversion to \gls{csv} took a few hours to complete.
This was likely due to the fact that \verb"nfdump" had to read the compressed NetFlow files from \gls{HDFS},
 and then write uncompressed \gls{csv} files to the same \gls{HDFS} volume.

After calculation, \gls{Giraph} writes output files containing all vertex IDs as values.
The vertex value (figure~\ref{fig:datatype-spreadrank-vertex-value}) consists of the \gls{depth} and the spreading from the vertex.
A Giraph \verb"OutputFormat" was implemented in order to make the output files better parseable.
The \verb"OutputFormat" writes tab separated lines, containing \emph{vertex ID}, \emph{number of outgoing edges} (clients) and the vertex value (reach and spreading).


\section{Longest path}
Most \gls{service}s on the internet do not exhibit spreading.
Figure~\ref{fig:spreading-perstep-pie} shows a plot of spreading per vertex, calculated over NetFlow information from one router over one day and over one month.
Most vertices have a spreading of zero, one or two.
A spreading of zero typically indicates that the host is a server, a spreading of one typically indicates that the host is a client (its traffic reaches the servers) and a spreading of two often indicates a hybrid, though it can also indicate a proxy server.
Higher spreading indicates hosts that do participate in spreading.
This is typical for DNS servers, SMTP servers and \gls{BGP} routers.

\end{figure}

\section{Protocols}
After filtering traffic such that only \gls{service}s with a spreading of one or higher,
 and a \gls{depth} of two or higher remain, only a few protocols show up (figure~\ref{fig:protocol-pie}).
This confirms the assumptions stated in section~\ref{sec:depth} and chapter~\ref{chp:anomalies},
 which is that only certain protocols exhibit spreading.

\Gls{BGP}, \gls{DNS} and \gls{SMTP} are expected to spread, due to the way the protocols work.
\Gls{BGP} is used between routers to calculate shortest paths; routers need to keep each other updated and will therefore initiate connections to each other at regular intervals.
\gls{DNS} and \gls{SMTP} are both protocols where clients send their request to a server that is close to them,
 and the server will handle the request itself, or forward to the request to another server.
In the case of \gls{DNS}, this means that the server will answer with information from its cache, or look the requested record up itself.
In the case of \gls{SMTP}, this means that the server will forward e-mail to the mail server of the recipient.
These services yield high \gls{depth}s, as virtually any server providing these services will eventually forward requests it receives.


\begin{figure}[h]
	\caption{Distribution of protocols that exhibit spreading}
	\label{fig:protocol-pie}

\end{figure}


The \gls{SSH} and \gls{HTTP} protocols also exhibit higher spreading.
The reason for this may be that home servers often serve web pages,
 and Linux-based home servers will typically also accept \gls{SSH} connections for remote management.
HTTP spreading is discussed in more detail in section~\ref{sec:http}.

Spreading is also observed on ports 666 and 445.
Port 666 is officially allocated as the port for both the Multiple Device Queueing System, and computer game Doom~\cite{rfc1700},
 but in practice it is also used by viruses.
Only one instance of spreading over port 666 was observed over one month,
 but due to the ambiguity of the port, it is not clear what kind of traffic this was.
Port 445 is used by Microsoft Windows for sharing files, but it is also abused for denial of service attacks~\cite{lazarevic2003comparative}.
Because of this, it is unknown whether this spreading was due to an attack, or simply some users that had used Microsoft Windows File Sharing.

\section{Diagram}
Individual observed services with a reach of one or higher are plotted in figure~\ref{fig:31day}.
It is based on one month's worth of NetFlow.

\begin{itemize}[label={$\bullet$}]
\item The X axis shows \gls{spreading} -- the amount of hosts reached via spreading -- the amount of messages received in total.
\item The Y axis shows \gls{depth} -- the longest path.
\item The size of the dot shows the amount of observed \gls{client}s -- the amount of incoming connections to the host.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

%The plots show a clear pattern.
%The pattern is not very clear in the plot from one day, but becomes clearer in the subsequet plots.
%The curve on the left side is simply an effect of the logarithmic scale of the plot;
% spreading can not be lower than the \gls{depth}.
%The plot has an E shape, with many services with few clients at the low end of the spreading,
% and few services with many clients at the high end of the spreading.
%Each protocol in the plot has its maximum reach.
%The maximum reach is favoured by services with a high spreading, hence the E shape of the plot.

\section{Observed anomalies}
Figure~\ref{fig:31day} shows all observed IP-address + port number pairs with a \gls{depth} of 2 or higher, during one month.
Similar diagrams from different timespans can be found in appendix~\ref{chp:diagrams}.
The best way to observe anomalies in this diagram, is by Multi-class Anomaly Detection.
Multi-class classification assumes that the data set contains different distinct types of data~\cite{Chandola:2009:ADS:1541880.1541882}.
In the case of SpreadRank, these types of data are the port numbers.
Different ports are indicated with different colours in the diagram, and it is apparent that there is a pattern (figure~\ref{fig:spreadrank-pattern}).
It apparent that there are some outliers, but there is no clear border between normal observations and anomalous observations;
however, a simple visual observation of the diagram does give some interesting results.

\subsection{Botnet}
\label{ssec:botnet}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\caption{HTTP and SSH traffic in SpreadRank over one month}
	\label{fig:31day-botnet}
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{31day-botnet}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:31day-botnet} shows \gls{HTTP} and \gls{SSH} services.
Dots marked with a solid line are linked to hosts that were reported to CERT.
The tiny red SSH node at the right hand side has been involved in \gls{SSH} scanning,
 where it connects to many IP addresses in the hope to find an SSH server with a password it can guess.

The large HTTP node at the right hand side is a host at \gls{ntnu}, and was confirmed participating in a botnet during December 2013,
 but was not discovered until January.
The host had many incoming and outgoing connections over port 80 in December.
After analysing the logs with more detail, it became apparent that it was contacted very often by servers hosting questionable content.
These servers were contacted by various other clients at \gls{ntnu} at a regular interval,
 but starting the 24th of December, some of these servers started contacting the host at \gls{ntnu}.
On January 1st, 2014, UNINETT CERT received a report stating that the machine participated in a botnet.

By matching the IP addresses that this botnet host had contact with,
 two additional hosts (marked with dotted lines) were discovered participating in the botnet.
Apparently this botnet does not make use of stealth technologies as outlined in section~\ref{sec:stealth}.
A possible reason for this, is that port 80 is a relatively ``safe'' port to communicate over;
 due to the high usage of HTTP ports for many different types of traffic (chapter~\ref{chp:anomalies}),
 system administrators may be inclined not to consider HTTP traffic when looking for anomalies.
SpreadRank has therefore proven to be a useful tool for finding these kinds of anomalies.

The two hosts (marked with dotted lines) were not reported to CERT, and were therefore never investigated.
According to information from \gls{DNS}, the host that got reported to CERT is a machine at a faculty at \gls{ntnu}.
The two hosts that were found using SpreadRank are computers at two different student villages at \gls{ntnu}.
More precise information is available at UNINETT, but cannot be published in this thesis for privacy reasons.


\subsection{DNS}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\caption{DNS traffic in SpreadRank over one month}
	\label{fig:31day-dns}
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{31day-dns}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:31day-dns} shows \gls{DNS} services, marked by which institution manages them.
DNS resolvers are used to look up DNS records for hosts inside the network.
These resolvers cannot be used from the outside, which is why the dots are small;
 the clients are inside the institution, and are therefore not logged by UNINETT's core routers (figure~\ref{fig:nodes}).

Authoritative DNS servers that cause spreading may seem like an anomaly;
 such authoritative DNS servers answer queries from clients and do not send queries themselves;
however, there is an explanation for this spreading:
In order to keep DNS zones available, most domains use multiple DNS servers.
These DNS servers must keep their records information synchronised, and will therefore periodically contact a master server if it is not itself the master for the DNS zone.


\subsection{SMTP}
SMTP is the protocol used for mail delivery, where sometimes an e-mail is forwarded a couple of times before it reaches a mailbox.
This causes spreading, which can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:31day}.
There are some SMTP servers that exhibit very high spreading, but these are simply hosts that handle large amounts of mail.
The diagram with SMTP servers would give a very comprehensive overview of e-mail usage at \gls{ntnu},
 but for privacy reasons this diagram is not included.
Such a diagram would give information about which parties \gls{ntnu} communicates with most,
 which includes companies that recruit at \gls{ntnu}.


\section{Performance}
UNINETT made a server cluster available for the analysis.
This cluster is installed with Apache Hadoop~\cite{Borthakur:2011:AHG:1989323.1989438}, and consists of 15 worker machines with 4~CPUs and 16~GB RAM each.
In addition, there are two HDFS name-nodes and one YARN manager, which have 4~CPUs and 10~GB RAM each.

Figure~\ref{fig:performance} shows how SpreadRank performs on this cluster,
 by NetFlow logs over one day, one week, two weeks and one month.
The logs are cumulative, so the one week log also contains the information from the one day log, etc.
Since every task is divided over multiple workers, of which multiple can run on one worker machine,
 the calculation times may fluctuate.
The figure shows one measurement where SpreadRank is run four times, for different NetFlow log sizes.
An interesting result is that the calculation of one week takes slightly longer than the calculation of two weeks.
This is probably by accident, the job may have been scheduled in such a way that multiple workers were located on the same physical machine.

\section{Comparison to other systems}
Software already exists to handle NetFlow logs.
The goal of most of this software is to make NetFlow logs more easily readable.
UNINETT currently uses NFSEN\footnote{\url{http://nfsen.sourceforge.net}} for analysis of NetFlow information.
NFSEN provides a web interface from which the NetFlow logs are easy accessible as text or aggregated in a diagram (figure~\ref{fig:details-graphs}).
The aggregated data from NFSEN can also be generated using MapReduce~\cite{Morken352472}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\caption{Screenshot of NFSEN (http://nfsen.sourceforge.net/details-graphs.png)}
	\label{fig:details-graphs}
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{details-graphs}
\end{figure}

SpreadRank, as implemented in this thesis, does not provide any database storage, diagram generation or user interfaces.
The plots shown in this thesis were created using modeling tools and spreadsheet software.
SpreadRank, instead, aggregates flows in a more recursive way, which gives additional metrics about hosts.
These metrics would be useful to integrate in NFSEN, but NFSEN in its current form does not support plugins.
Software similar to NFSEN is FlowViewer\footnote{\url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/flowviewer/}} and SiLK~\footnote{\url{https://tools.netsa.cert.org/silk/}}.
