\chapter{Commands}

During this study,
SpreadRank was run on YARN, and results were written to text files.
This appendix will show the commands used to convert NetFlow to \gls{csv},
 start SpreaRank with these \gls{csv} files,
 and filter the results.

\section{Convert NetFlow to CSV}
NetFlow can be converted to a \gls{csv} file, with non-UDP and non-TCP flows filtered out, as well as flows between port numbers that are both over 1024.
This conversion is done using FlowConvert.sh, but in order to generate separate \gls{csv} files, FlowConvert must be run for each timeframe that a \gls{csv} file should span.
This snippet of \gls{bash} code will run FlowConvert.sh 31 times, for every day of the month.
The end result will be a directory named \verb"trd_gw1_12_filtered.csv" with 31 files.

\subsection{NetflowCSVEdgeInputFormat.java}
\begin{verbatim}
	seq 1 9 | while read nr
	do
	    sh FlowConvert.sh -R trd_gw1/12/0$nr | cat > trd_gw1_12_filtered.csv/part-0000$nr &
	done
	seq 10 31 | while read nr
	do
	    sh FlowConvert.sh -R trd_gw1/12/$nr | cat > trd_gw1_12_filtered.csv/part-000$nr &
	done
\end{verbatim}

\section{Execute SpreadRank}
In order to execute SpreadRank on YARN,
 YARN must be started with the SpreadRank jarfile,
 and the full qualified class-name of the computation class.
Additionally, a format for reading the graph at the start, and writing the graph at the end must be provided.
In this case, we use a directory to store the graph data.
The directory contains chunks of the full graph.

\begin{verbatim}
	yarn \
	 jar giraph-rank-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT-for-hadoop-2.3.0-cdh5.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
	 org.apache.giraph.GiraphRunner no.uninett.yorn.giraph.computation.SpreadRank \
	 -eif no.uninett.yorn.giraph.format.io.NetflowCSVEdgeInputFormat \
	 -eip /user/hdfs/trd_gw1_12_filtered.csv \
	 -vof no.uninett.yorn.giraph.format.io.RankVertexOutputFormat \
	 -op /user/hdfs/rank-out/IPSpreadRank_gw1_12 \
	 -wc org.apache.giraph.worker.DefaultWorkerContext \
	 -w 16 \
	 -yj giraph-rank-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT-for-hadoop-2.3.0-cdh5.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar
