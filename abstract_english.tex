\noindent Anomaly detection in internet traffic is currently largely based on quantifying traffic data.
This thesis proposes a new algorithm SpreadRank,
 which detects spreading of traffic on the internet.
Spreading can be used as an additional metric for traffic anomaly detection, and can be observed from large scale traffic logs from core routers.
Studying spreading is a useful tool in determining the role of an end-host and identifying malicious behaviour.
SpreadRank uses large scale graph processing to calculate spreading from multiple gigabytes of traffic data.
