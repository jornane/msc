\begin{abstract}
\noindent Writing this Master's thesis has been an educative experience.
I would like to gratefully acknowledge the guidance, support and encouragement of my supervisors, Yuming Yiang from \gls{ntnu} and Gurvinder Singh from UNINETT AS, as well as Tor Gjerde from UNINETT for his continued availability, enthusiasm and willingness to provide data and expert opinions. My gratitude extends to Arne Øslebø and Rune Sydskjør at UNINETT for providing me with the opportunity to check my findings against UNINETT's logging systems.

Finally, I would like to thank my family for giving me support throughout,
 and to my friends in Norway for being there when I needed them, and for inviting me to dinner when I was too busy to cook.
